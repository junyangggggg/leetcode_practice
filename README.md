# leetcode_practice
This is where I practice leetcode problems. I took only one programming course
in my previous semester so my code isn't as efficient as it can be. I'm currently
planning to self-learn data structures and algorithms during the coming summer break.
Hope I can develop a clearer logical thinking and problem-solving skills by keep on
practising.
